Even though the project is simple, I structured it using modern backend concepts: Microservices, RabbitMQ, and Docker. Each service runs independently and communicates asynchronously, making the system modular, scalable, and resilient.

✨ Project Highlights:

👤 User Service: Handles user creation and storage.

📝 Task Service: Manages user tasks and communicates with other services asynchronously.

🔔 Notification Service: Listens to task creation events and processes them independently.

🛠 Key Technologies Used:

🏗 Microservices: Each service runs independently, making the system modular and scalable.

📨 RabbitMQ: Acts as a message broker between services, ensuring smooth asynchronous communication.

🐳 Docker: Containerized all services for consistency and easy deployment across environments.

💻 Node.js, Express, MongoDB: Core backend stack for building the services.

💡 Why I Built This:
Even though the project is simple, integrating Microservices, RabbitMQ, and Docker made it more realistic and helped me understand how complex systems handle independent services and reliable communication.
